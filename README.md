#Native AngularJs drag and drop directive#

An easy to use, native, directive to enable drag/drop in your angular app.  This directive has no dependency on jQuery or other frameworks, it does require a browser that supports the HTML5 drag/drop events.
You can combine keys (ctrl, alt, shift) with the drag and drop.

## dataTransfer hack

The jQuery event object does not have a dataTransfer property... true, but one can try:


    jQuery.event.props.push('dataTransfer');
